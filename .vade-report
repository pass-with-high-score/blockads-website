# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1` using npm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Code Changes
**Modified: `app/layout.tsx`**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the `<Footer />` component
- This placement ensures analytics are tracked across all pages while maintaining the existing page structure

## Implementation Details
- Project Type: Next.js App Router (detected from `app` directory structure)
- Package Manager: npm (detected from `package-lock.json`)
- TypeScript: Yes (layout.tsx file)
- Root Layout File: `app/layout.tsx`

## Verification
✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ Linter ran successfully with no new errors introduced
✓ All changes follow Next.js best practices for App Router
✓ Analytics component placed correctly in the root layout

## Notes
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and Web Vitals
- Analytics will only collect data when deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required for basic analytics tracking
- The component is non-blocking and won't affect page performance
